              I am participating in the company's professional development program for data science, which is a rotational program designed to produce data science leaders.
              For my first rotation, I am working in AI Solutions for Sales, Marketing, and Customer Engagement, where I serve as a global technical lead for the company's
              churn prediction and market forecasting products. My responsibilities are to oversee the implementation of scalable ETL and ML pipelines in the Azure Databricks
              platform, develop more accurate and interpretable ML algorithms, and ensure the insights are actively supporting business teams in their decision-making processes. 
              I am also an associate product manager for our market modeling portfolio, where I devise data-driven product strategies for helping business units plan
              future production with insights into future demand and emerging markets.
              In addition to these projects, I consult/teach other data science teams in business and manufacturing domains on building scalable data science solutions with
              Azure, Databricks, and Spark.
              My current contributions are:
