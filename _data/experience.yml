              BASF is a Global Fortune 500 company, the largest chemicals company in the world, and a leader in sustainable manufacturing and material development.
              I am participating in the company's professional development program for data science, which is a rotational program designed to produce data science leaders.
              In my first rotation, I worked in AI Solutions for Sales, Marketing, and Customer Engagement, where I worked on churn prediction and market modeling solutions. 
              I was product manager for a market intelligence product that helped make strategic business development more data-driven.
              In addition to these projects, I consult/teach other data science teams in business and manufacturing domains on building scalable data science solutions with
              Azure, Databricks, and Spark.
              My current contributions are:
  bullets:
        - line: Scaled ETL and machine learning pipelines using PySpark/Databricks; realized a 3500% performance boost
        - line: Implemented end-to-end data science products for business teams (churn, market models) equipped with MLOps and DataOps using Databricks, Azure Data Lake, Azure Data Factory, Delta Lake, MLflow, PowerBI, and Python
        - line: Designed innovative market sizing system that synthesizes and combines 6 different data sources to generate market intelligence that cannot be purchased from a third-party firm; built to inform strategic decision making
        - line: Managed team of 4 developers in building a custom market intelligence product for internal clients in strategic business development; bridged business needs and technical development by communicating with stakeholders and translating business problems into tangible solutions
