              UT Austin is one of the world's leading universities in energy research. When I was a student, I was interested specifically in solar energy, 
              but I realized there were few opportunities for undergraduate students to get involved. To fill the gap, I founded Texas Solar Energy Group
              to provide a space for students interested in solar energy to conduct student-led research and engineering projects on the topic. During my time as President,
              the organization grew to over 30 student members, received over $5,000 in funds from grants and awards, established partnerships with several solar energy startups,
              won the Undergraduate Research Fellowship twice, placed 2nd out of 16 teams at an energy case competition, 
              and placed 2nd out of 7 teams at an alternative energy pitch competition.
